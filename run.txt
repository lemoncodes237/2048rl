Adavantage:
Compared with Greedy, MCTS can get more
information about the future benefit and do a
wiser choice.
Disadavange:
Tree search causes larger time complexicty.
UCB = vi/vp + c*√(2ln(np))/ni
C is a constant to determine the trend.
We find when c=0.3, the AI get highest score.
UCB value function
Played by MCTS agent
Our modification:
We use (vp/vi) to replace original v only for we
couldn't easily use +1,0, 1 to assess the game state
and the range of vi(or vp) can be out of control.
